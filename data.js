Given the rigid/uniform structure of the data (all room reviews have the same properties that take the same data type), I suspected that a SQL database would be most appropriate, but I decided to test a SQL database (Postgres) versus a NoSQL database (Cassandra) to find the fastest query speeds for my use case. As I suspected, Postgres outperformed Cassandra initially. After adding a secondary index to the room_id property, Postgres achieved an average latency of 3 milliseconds (versus 18 with Cassandra) and 400 requests per second (versus 150 with Cassandra). To further improve performance, I implemented load balancers to distribute requests among multiple servers.',
