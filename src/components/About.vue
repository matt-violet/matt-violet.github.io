    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>
      Throughout my career I've sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns — from tutoring students of underserved schools in East Oakland, to empowering Burmese migrant communities in Thailand, to establishing a new communications department for a social justice non-profit in Berkeley — I've never stopped following my passion to help others and solve problems.

      My passion for programming comes from the role software plays in my personal health, as a self-identified <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8tp35PoCCbMzuWLTPHFI5oGN7nFhIQ1/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>human cyborg</a> who has used an "artificial pancreas" to manage his type one diabetes since 2016. With my daily well-being now literally tied to algorithms, I'm invested in learning and developing applications that have the potential to help others as much as these devices have helped me.

      When not coding I can be found making music, Photoshop creations, and social distancing in my hometown of Oakland, CA.
