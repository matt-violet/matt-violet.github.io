    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="bio-text">
      I'm a multitalented software engineer with roots in the non-profit world. I specialize in designing and developing full stack web applications.
    </p>
    <p class="bio-text">
      My passion for programming comes from the role technology plays in my daily health, as a self-identified <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8tp35PoCCbMzuWLTPHFI5oGN7nFhIQ1/view?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>human cyborg</a> who has managed his type one diabetes with an "artificial pancreas" since 2016. With my health now literally tied to algorithms, I'm committed to learning and developing applications that have the potential to help others as much as these devices have helped me.

    <p class="bio-text">
      When not coding I can be found making music, Photoshop creations, and social distancing in my hometown of Oakland, CA.
